  "Description": "    The cramped office set into the wall is surprisingly spartan. A small desk sits slightly offset from the middle of the room, and a board of job postings hangs on one of the walls, while a poster on the wall directly across from the door proclaims 'Join the Noonbreeze Guard! Defend our town from the forces of evil!'. ",

  "Description": "    The passage here is completely dark, though fortunately that's not a problem at the moment. It's hard to tell direction in here, but a faint light one way down the tunnel indicates the entrance to the cave. The other way down the tunnel is dark but you can just make out a fork in the path up ahead.",

  "Description": "    The gate, a large rusted portcullis, is set into the wall here. The packed dirt path from the forest transforms quickly into neat clean cobblestones at the threshold of the town. The lax demeanor of the guards and the rust on the portcullis tell of the general safety of the surrounding countryside.",

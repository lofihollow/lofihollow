  "Description": "    The road becomes quite spacious here, a bit wider than two wagons wide. A variety of shops overlook the street itself. A smaller street leads south to the commons, while a similar street on the other side leads to the artisan's quarter. The main road stretches to the east gate in one direction and the town plaza in the other.",

  "Description": "    The room is a little bare, but that was to be expected from the price. A small round glass window overlooks the streets below. The door leading back out to the main room is unadorned cheap wood, but still solid enough to provide a measure of safety against thieves. Most of the space of the room is taken up by a simple wooden bed with plain cloth sheets, and a single pillow and blanket.",

  "ChitChats": { 
	"Noonbreeze": "0~Not as busy as the city was,|  but sometimes that's a good thing.",
	"the Bar": "1~Tom's a great guy, his brew is second to none.",
	"the Harvest": "0~Fixing ploughs and scythes for the harvest pays well,|   but its boring as hell.",
	"the Weather": "-1~Weather comes, weather goes.|   Talking about it won't change it, so why bother?",
	"Current Events": "0~I don't keep up with the news.",
	"Politics": "-1~I try not to take too much of an interest in politics.||But Cedars' as good as mayors get.",
	"the City": "3~Wingjoy's a great place.|   You wouldn't believe what kinds of stuff you can buy there.||I almost miss it.",
	"the Desert": "-2~The forge keeps me hot enough, and as much as I love it|   I wouldn't want to live in one.",
	"the Forest": "1~Gotta get charcoal somewhere.||The Merchant's Guild's prices are too steep,|   so I just gather my own.",
	"the Ocean": "3~I hear they forge metal in deep sea vents.||I'd love to try that someday.",
	"the Lake": "2~The lake freezes over in the winter.|   Walking across the ice is the only way into that old mine.||I hear there's some great metals in there.|   @, I'll pay real well if you get me some.",
	"Gossip": "-1~If you're looking for gossip you wont get any from me.||Spreading rumors isn't my style.",
	"the Merchant's Guild": "-1~I stay out of their way and they stay out of mine.||They tried to buy me out a few years back,|   keep me from selling to anyone but them.",
	"the Adventurer's Guild": "1~The Merchant's Guild is consistent,|   but adventurers bring me the good stuff.||Much cheaper too.",
	"the Thieves Guild": "-3~Scum of the earth,|   I can't tell you how many times they've stolen from my shop.", 
	"(Annoy)": "-3~Did you just come here to waste my time?||I'm too busy for this.",

	"(Cry)": "-1~What're you making a commotion for?||Nothing is worth all that blubbering.",
	"(Complain)": "-2~Whining won't sharpen a dull blade.||Get to work or get to being quiet.",
	"(Compliment)": "1~I appreciate it|   but I'd appreciate you not mentioning it anymore.",
	"(Entertain)": "-1~Are you done? I've got work to do.",
	"(Insult)": "-4~What the hell do you mean my work is as ill-tempered as I am?!||I've fought stronger men for less, so get out of my sight|   before I use you for 'quality control.'",
	"(Intimidate)": "-1~I've seen dull blades sharper than you, kid.",
	"(Joke)": "2~Ha! 'The cobblestones'! Love that one, got any more?",
	"(Tease)": "0~Is that supposed to be a weak attempt at an insult?",

	"(Brag)": "-1~Stop trying to impress me, kid.||I've heard it all a dozen times.",
	"(Give an Opinion)": "-1~Interesting take,|   but next time keep it to yourself, yeah?",
	"(Rude Gesture)": "1~I hear out East, that gesture means 'excellent meal'.||I'm sure that's what you meant, and not the other thing.",
	"Cooking": "2~I make a mean sourdough.||You'd be surprised how many skills transfer from|   blacksmithing to baking.",
	"Nature": "1~Nature's relaxing, I didn't get much of it in the city.|   Maybe not as relaxing as watching molten metal pour into a mold.||But still pretty good.",
	"Work": "2~So much work to do, and so little time in the day!||If I could smith while sleeping, I'd never stop.|   Wouldn't want to keep the whole town up at night though.",
	"Sports": "1~I didn't play much sports in my youth,|   but they can be fun to watch.||I hear Wingjoy still has the best athletes around.",
	"Dancing": "1~Dancing isn't for me.||It certainly takes a lot of skill and precision,|   and that's impressive, but it's not for me.",
	"Exercise": "3~Smithing is all the exercise I need!|   You could probably do with a bit of exercise though.|   You can never be too strong!",
	"Books": "-1~I'd rather forge a sword than read a book.",
	"Home": "1~I'm from Wingjoy, to the west. It's an amazing place, but|   Noonbreeze is my home now.",
	"Jobs": "1~You ever need work, come and let me know!||I can always use an apprentice around the shop.",
	"Adventuring": "3~If I wasn't a smith, I'm sure I'd be an adventurer like you.||But be careful out there,|   wouldn't want you dying and losing all that ore!||Also, you know, your life.",
	"Sleeping": "-1~Plenty of time to sleep when I'm dead.",
	"Health": "1~You can never be too healthy.|    Daily exercise and good meals, that's the key to a long life.",
	"Music": "2~Sometimes, it feels like I'm making music and not pounding metal.||It doesn't happen often, but that's when I make my best work.",
	"Money": "1~I'm not exactly rich, but I'm certainly not a pauper.||The copper really rolls in when groups of adventurers stop by,|   they'll pay out their ears for high-end gear.",
	"Fishing": "-2~Fishing is the most boring thing I've tried in my life.||I can't understand how people can do it for fun.",
	"Magic": "1~Magic's useful and all, but nothing beats hand-crafted.||Of course, enchanted blades will do you better than mundane ones.",
	"Monsters": "1~They're dangerous, fierce creatures.|   They'll kill you if you aren't careful.||Their hides make the best leather though, get me some if you can."

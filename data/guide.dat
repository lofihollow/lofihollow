Getting Started

Your first order of business should be ensuring that you have a place
 to stay. You pass out automatically at 2 am (26:00) each day, unless
you sleep in a bed before then. The two early options for housing are
staying at the Inn, which costs around 30 coppr per night, or paying
for an apartment. The apartment is a better long term solution but
costs more up front, requiring around 6 silver each month. These
prices can both be lowered by befriending the relevant shopkeepers.

The longer term solution is buying the Farm - literally. This is no
small undertaking, costing a minimum of a gold piece - 100 silvers,
the equivalent of nearly two years of an apartment. The benefits of
this however are never having to pay rent again, plus you can grow
crops and raise animals. You probably can't buy the farm immediately
but it's something to plan for eventually.

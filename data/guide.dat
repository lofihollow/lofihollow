Getting Started

Your first order of business should be ensuring that you have a place
 to stay. You pass out automatically at 2 am (26:00) each day, unless
you sleep in a bed before then. The two early options for housing are
staying at the Inn, which costs around 30 coppr per night, or paying
for an apartment. The apartment is a better long term solution but
costs more up front, requiring around 6 silver each month. These
prices can both be lowered by befriending the relevant shopkeepers.

The longer term solution is buying the Farm - literally. This is no
small undertaking, costing a minimum of a gold piece - 100 silvers,
the equivalent of nearly two years of an apartment. The benefits of
this however are never having to pay rent again, plus you can grow
crops and raise animals. You probably can't buy the farm immediately
but it's something to plan for eventually.
























Jobs Around Town

There's a variety of jobs around town that you can do to earn money.

Apothecary: Solve puzzles with number clues (nonogram/picross)
Bartending: Slide customers drinks to them from across the bar
Blacksmithing: Click on groups of tiles to clear them and earn points
Farm Supply: Catch falling fruit and avoid catching spiders
General Store: Find all the mines without clicking on them to win
Hardware Store: Stack crates to pass the line as fast as possible
Pet Shop: Flip light switches until all 25 lights are on





























The Farm

Owning the farm opens up all kinds of fun possibilities. You can grow
crops, take care of animals, build your own buildings, and more. The
downside is that it costs an entire gold piece to purchase the permit,
the equivalent of ten thousand copper coins. It's not something you
can get easily, and is intended to be something you get a decent way
into a save. Playing in multiplayer and pooling your money allows you
to acquire the farm faster, but only the host unlocks the farm. Use
money from animal products and growing crops to buy the farm for
everyone else!
